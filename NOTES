Rule Caching
------------

notify()

- It builds up the qual object, then qual build object, then ruleset object (default ruleset for build) from the qualID
    - Can these objects be cached?
- When its found the ruleset, it loads the rules, and the steps beneath
    - These can surely be cached as they will hardly ever change.
    - Just make sure when a qual structure or qual build is updated, it clears the rule cache

If that makes no real difference, could also look at caching actual qual/unit/structure objects, so they don't have to be retrieved from DB and loaded each time.
Would need to ensure any time they are changed, the cache is cleared.
